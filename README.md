# Home Energy Project: Machine Learning for Energy Forecasting and Analysis

This project demonstrates a machine learning (ML) pipeline to analyze, forecast, and evaluate energy usage patterns in residential settings. Using personal energy usage data collected over multiple years, the project builds predictive models that could be extended for applications like **Measurement and Verification (M&V)** of energy savings or accurate energy/demand forecasting.

## **Project Objectives**
1. **Understand Energy Usage**:
   - Analyze historical energy consumption patterns using time-series data.
   - Incorporate external factors such as weather conditions to better understand variations in usage.

2. **Develop Predictive Models**:
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., LightGBM) to forecast energy usage, with a focus on capturing both regular patterns and rare usage spikes.

3. **Build a Scalable Framework**:
   - Create a generalizable pipeline that can be adapted for larger datasets or deployed for real-world objectives such as:
     - Guaranteed energy savings measurement (M&V).
     - Building energy demand forecasting for grid optimization.

## **Use Case: Guaranteed Energy Savings (M&V)**
This approach can serve as a foundation for Measurement and Verification (M&V) in energy savings projects. By accurately predicting baseline energy usage based on historical data and weather patterns:
- It becomes possible to quantify energy savings post-implementation of energy efficiency measures.
- This is critical for contractual agreements, such as performance-based energy savings contracts.

### **Why This Is Important**
M&V is a cornerstone of energy efficiency programs, ensuring that:
- Energy efficiency improvements deliver promised savings.
- Stakeholders (e.g., utilities, building owners) can trust the reported outcome
